### Bar mekko graphics in R

This is a quick introduction to the bar mekko function* in
the mekko package.

Its main value is to add quantitative context to a bar graph, via bar width.

```{r set-opts, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 7,
  fig.height = 4
)
```
<br>
Install with:
```{r install-mekko-package, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("mekko")
```

You can also install the development version with 
`devtools::install_github('ryninho/mekko', build_vignettes = TRUE)`.

View examples with:
```{r open-vignette, eval=FALSE}
vignette("mekko-vignette")
```

First we'll load ggplot and mekko and create some example data.
```{r load-packages, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(mekko)
```

```{r create-example-data}
profits <- data.frame(
  product = c('widgets', 'sprockets', 'whosits', 'cogs', 'whatsits'),
  profit_margin = c(3.2, -1.4, -5.5, 0.5, 9.4),
  revenue = c(1150, 1900, 250, 700, 75)
  )
```

### Bar mekko

Now let's take a look at profit margin by product using ggplot2.

```{r current-state-bad-example-bar-mekko}
ggplot(profits, aes(x = product, y = profit_margin, fill = product)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

Well that's insightful, but I don't know how worried I should be about the
margin on whosits or cogs, nor do I know how happy I should be about whatsits
knocking it out of the park. Maybe I can add revenue as the bar width so I know
what's important here?

```{r ggplot-bar-width-fail}
ggplot(profits, aes(x = product, y = profit_margin, width = revenue, position = "stack", fill = product)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

Well shucks, that looks like some kind of Atari graphics airplane. Let's use the
mekko package to put our margins in context.

```{r bar-mekko-example}
bmx <- barmekko(profits, product, profit_margin, revenue)
bmx
```

Alright, so actually the weak profit margins on sprockets may be worth nearly as 
much focus as the problem with whosits. Also, no high-fives for margins on the 
whatsits until we triple sales of them.

Those labels are a little close together- this is a ggplot object so let's use
the usual method of rotating the axes.

```{r bar-mekko-extension}
bmx + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```

When sorting by the width variable it usually pushes noise to one end
```{r}
state.x77 %>% 
  data.frame %>% 
  rownames_to_column("State") %>% 
  arrange(Population) %>% 
  barmekko(State, Murder, Population) + 
  coord_flip() + 
  theme(legend.position="none") + 
  ggtitle("Murder Rate by State", 
  subtitle = "1977 Census (R dataset)") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(
    size = rel(1.5))
  )
```

Here we see how it can give us a sense of the weighted distribution of something
```{r}
state.x77 %>% 
  data.frame %>% 
  rownames_to_column("State") %>% 
  arrange(Murder) %>% 
  barmekko(State, Murder, Population) + 
  coord_flip() + 
  theme(legend.position="none") + 
  ggtitle("Murder Rate by State", 
  subtitle = "1977 Census (R dataset)") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(
    size = rel(1.5))
  )
```

### Appendix

* This package originally included a marimekko function as well, but the latter 
was discovered to be well covered in [other](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggmosaic/vignettes/ggmosaic.html) [packages](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Product-Plots-Wickham-Hofmann/0598a59354cb96161d68dab91fb0de21fb8671fd/figure/6), so it was removed to simplify maintenance
* While the barmekko is a ggplot object, your mileage may vary when attempting operations that normally would work on a ggplot object, as the data frame is deconstructed in the process of creating the graph
